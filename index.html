It is a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel." Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon contains the teachings of Jesus Christ, and helps everyone who reads it to come closer to Him.</p>

                        The Book of Mormon means so much to me. The Book of Mormon has changed my life for the better. When I was younger, I remember reading through the Book of Mormon with my family. I didn’t take it seriously until I was a teenager in high school. I regret to say that I took it for granted for most of my life. I believed that the Church was true, Jesus was my Savior, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. But a deeper knowledge and understanding of these truths didn’t come until later. I was blessed with some fantastic seminary teachers that bore the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon to me that helped to shape my testimony. I remember reading through the Book of Mormon for seminary, and that was the first time I had read through it. But on my mission was when I had a powerful experience reading it. My mission president gave us a 90 day Book of Mormon reading challenge so we would have read through the entirety of the Book of Mormon by the end of my first 2 transfers. I read through the Book of Mormon multiple times on my mission, and helped me to gain a great appreciation for my Savior. After learning Nepali and working with Nepali refugees, it helped me to understand and appreciate the simple truths found within those pages more and more. It helped me to understand how important it is to read it to gain a greater testimony of my Savior and His restored gospel.
